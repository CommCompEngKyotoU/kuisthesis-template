## Supported Engines

- upLaTeX (with dvipdfmx)
- LuaLaTeX
- pdfLaTeX

### Note for pdfLaTeX users

Use `~` (tilde) between Japanese and English text to insert proper spacing:
```latex
日本語~\LaTeX~を使う
```
For upLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, tildes work as usual (non-breaking space), since spacing is inserted automatically.
